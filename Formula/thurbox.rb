# Homebrew formula for thurbox.
#
# This is the canonical source, kept in the main repo. CI (the
# `publish-homebrew` job in .github/workflows/cd.yml) copies it to the
# Thurbeen/homebrew-thurbox tap on every release, with `version` and the
# per-platform `sha256` values bumped to that release. The values below are
# a last-known-good template — CI overrides them per release.
#
#   brew install thurbeen/thurbox/thurbox
#
# Only the platforms with a published release artifact are supported:
#   - macOS arm64 (Apple Silicon) -> aarch64-apple-darwin
#   - Linux x86_64                -> x86_64-unknown-linux-musl (static)
#   - Linux aarch64               -> aarch64-unknown-linux-musl (static)
# Intel macOS has no release binary, so it is omitted (brew reports "no
# available formula" there).

  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      thurbox needs tmux >= 3.2 and a coding-agent CLI (claude, codex, antigravity,
      opencode, aider, …) on your PATH. Launch the TUI with `thurbox`; the
      scriptable headless interface is `thurbox-cli`.
    EOS
  end

  test do
    # The TUI (`thurbox`) has no headless mode, so only assert it is installed
    # and executable. `thurbox-cli` is a clap CLI: `--version` exits 0 and
    # prints a semver-shaped marker (the build-time release version is injected
    # into the TUI's status bar, not into clap's CARGO_PKG_VERSION).
